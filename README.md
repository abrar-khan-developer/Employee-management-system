# Employee Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

Employee Management System is a web application built using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**. The application provides separate dashboards for **Admin** and **Employee** users after login.

The system allows the **Admin** to assign new tasks to employees, and employees can view and manage their assigned tasks from their own dashboard. All application data is stored using **Local Storage**, so no backend database is required.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The application starts with a **Login Form**.
2. Users can log in as either:
   - **Admin**
   - **Employee**
3. After successful login:
   - The **Admin** is redirected to the **Admin Dashboard**.
   - The **Employee** is redirected to the **Employee Dashboard**.
4. The **Admin** can assign new tasks to any employee.
5. Assigned tasks are stored in **Local Storage**.
6. Employees can log in to their dashboard and view all tasks assigned to them.
7. Employees can update the status of their tasks (such as Active, Completed, or Failed).
